In addFile and removeFile -folders only lambda codes for developing.
In lambdas.yaml cloudformation template for deploying the two lambdas. (Adding lambda is made a little denser cause of space limit in yaml; it would be nice to keep functionality in sync between lamdas yaml and code folders above)

aws/sillari-cf/common.yaml has the same as in lamdas.yaml but integarted to the whole cloudformation; keep this in syc also.
